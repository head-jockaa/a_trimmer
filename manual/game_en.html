<H2>- How to play -</H2>
</CENTER>
When the round light appears, an anime is televised there.<BR>
Let's fish for it with adjusting a channel.<BR>
By the way, the red light shows that 2 programs are televised,<BR>
the yellow light shows that more than 3 programs are televised.<BR>
And then anime is televised on DBS when the sea is rough.<BR>
Let's gather all of them to be the anime master. <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>Explanation of the screen</FONT><BR>
<LI>moving mode<BR>
<IMG SRC=img/walk.png><BR>
The altitude at that point is displayed when the player stops.<BR>
The number, which is sometimes shown at the downright, shows the "rural ratings".<BR><BR>
<LI>Antenna mode<BR>
<IMG SRC=img/turn.png><BR>
The altitude at the radio tower is displayed under the buoy. The amount of tower height is added, too.<BR>
When the radiowave is diffracted on the summit, the altitude at that point is displayed as well.<BR>
The stuff like a buoy shows horizontal polarization by horizontal stripes, vertical polarization by vertical stripes.<BR>
The yellow meter shows the reception level of radiowave. When getting interferrence, it turns red by that amount.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>How to make high score</FONT><BR>
The following are the 3 conditions that the score of anime you've catched gets high.<BR><BR>
<LI>Televised by few stations or televised few times a week.<BR>
<LI>Received from a small scale radio tower that output is weak.<BR>
<LI>Received at the point which "rural ratings" is high.<BR><BR>
The rural ratings are automatically calculated by the data of televising anime.<BR>
As the number of anime programs in an area is smaller, the score gets higher.<BR><BR>
<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>
<IMG SRC=img/score1.png><BR><BR>
Low score even if you catch a famous anime in the city
</TD><TD>
<IMG SRC=img/score2.png><BR><BR>
High score if you catch a rare anime in the country

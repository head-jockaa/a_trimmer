<H2>- Various antennas -</H2>
</CENTER>
Several kinds of antennas are prepared for using in this game.<BR>
You can choose Simple Rod and Convenience Rod from the beginning.<BR>
Other antennas will be added if you buy them at the shop.<BR>
You can choose them by opening Menu during the game.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Simple Rod</FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC=img/simple.png><BR>
This is the most simple antenna that you turn a channel number with arrow key.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Convenience Rod</FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC=img/convenient.png><BR>
This shows the table of TV stations receivable above a definite level.<BR>
You move the cursor with up-down key and decide it with Z key.<BR>
If it's trouble to press Z key, you can use "turn over channels" with left-right key.<BR>
I guess this is the most convenient as a game.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>UV Rod</FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC=img/uv.png><BR>
This is a classical antenna that separates the dial into VHF and UHF.<BR>
It's an antique idea.<BR>
You choose the dials with up-down key and turn it with left-right key.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>MHz Rod</FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC=img/mhz.png><BR>
This is an antenna that adjusts a frequency, in the same way as a radio.<BR>
You move a graduation with left-right key.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Button Rod</FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC=img/button.png><BR>
This is the regular button-style.<BR>
You choose a button with arrow key and press it with Z key.<BR>
S button will start to set TV channels.<BR>
It has "Area code settings", almost good for nothing, as well as "Auto channel settings".<BR>
It's just a rummage. Not useful for playing the game.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Super Handy Rod</FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC=img/superhandy.png><BR>
This is the developed version of Convenience Rod.<BR>
This displays the entire radiowaves receivable above a definite level.<BR>
This table displays TV station's name, radiowave's power, relay station's name, from the left.

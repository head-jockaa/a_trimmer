<H2>- About this software -</H2>
</CENTER>
<LI>Really, I want to make a story mode, but it's not essential, so I made it as v1.0 here.<BR><BR>
<LI>About English version<BR>
Please press A key to change into English text.<BR>
The titles of anime programs do not change to English for now.<BR><BR>
This software is aiming at the thing we can tell it at a glance, rather than realistic reproduction.<BR>
<LI>Basically, the number of ERP, altitude, radiotower height is not precise.<BR>
It's difficult to collect data about these, we keep it within general reproduction.<BR>
<LI>we keep the reproduction of radiowave's property within possible range as well.<BR><BR>
